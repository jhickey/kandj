    <h3>Kate Gilmore</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>Katherine Erna Gilmore grew up in Dedham MA surrounded by poodles, which may explain how she turned out the way she did. After poodles, Kate's second love is cool buildings, which she points out to Jimmy wherever they go. Kate met Jimmy during their second month of college and was immediately drawn in by his keen wit and incredible fashion sense. Nearly nine years later, Jimmy proposed to Kate in the middle of Oberlin's Tappan Square, not far from where they first met.</p>

    <h3>Jimmy Hickey</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>Jimmy Hickey grew up in Frederick, Maryland. As a young kid he thought he wanted to be a marine biologist.  And while this career track has not panned out, his love of cephalopods endures. His odd affection for all things related to squids, octopi and cuttlefish is just one of the many things that attracted Kate to Jimmy Hickey.  Jimmy met Kate during the fall of their first year at Oberlin in 2003. Their first date was at a house party dancing to Justin Timberlake, followed by a romantic dinner at Downtown Pizza, a scuzzy pizza joint you only go to after consuming a few drinks. On their way to Downtown Pizza, Jimmy announced, “ I don’t have any money” to which Kate replied, “Don’t worry I do.” The rest is history...</p>
